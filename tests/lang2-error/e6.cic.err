I am expecting the following two values to be the same (_: String) -> (_1: String) -> (_2: String) * String.
But they are not.
from:
  (_) => (_1) => cons(_, _1)
to:
  (_) => (_1) => cons(_1, _)

previous:
- same
- { Equal((_: String) -> (_: String) -> (_: String) * String, (x) => (y) => cons(x, y), (y) => (x) => cons(x, y)) -- same }
