<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap;">About knowledge, logic, formal inference rule and computation

- knowledge := fixation of belief.

- belief := that upon which a man is prepared to act.

- logic := the system we use to express beliefs.

- inference rule := definition of judgment (belief).
  - by giving algorithm to check whether a group of data is evidence of the judgment,
    which is the same as type checking algorithm.
  - use a group of data constructors to define a type constructor,
    is one way of doing this.
  - this is introduction, how about elimination?
    - we need elimination rule about arrow elimination
      to do computation by substitution.
    - although we have general pattern matching and recursion
      to do computation for all other algebraic data type,
      we still can use elimination rule to
      1. make sure all cases are covered;
      2. avoid recursion.

- computation := directed changes (simulation of action).
