## ex falso quodlibet

The eliminator `absurd_ind` corresponds to a principle of thought.

If a false statement were true, then we might as well say anything at all.
a.k.a. "Principle of Explosion" or "ex falso quodlibet", which means "from false, anything."

## `nat_equal_consequence`

``` cicada
def nat_consequence_t(x: Nat, y: Nat): Type =
  nat_rec(
    x,
    nat_rec(
      y,
      Trivial,
      (_, _) => Absurd),
    (prev_x, _) => nat_rec(
      y,
      Absurd,
      (prev_y, _) => Equal(Nat, prev_x, prev_y)))

def same_nat_consequence(n: Nat): nat_consequence_t(n, n) =
  nat_ind(
    n,
    (target) => nat_consequence_t(target, target),
    sole,
    (_prev, _almost) => same)
```

## Imagine That ...

Using types, it is possible to assume things that may or
may not be true, and then see what can be concluded
from these assumptions.

## Two (or more) kinds of equalities

There are more things equal than are the same.
Sameness is a simple kind of (more general) equality.

- `same` -- definitional and computational equality
- `Equal` -- propositional equality -- requires proof

The fact that any two expressions either are or are not the same means that
we are freed from the obligation to provide a proof
because sameness can be determined by following the Laws and Commandments.

Equality requires proof, and therefore is more expressive.
Recognizing a proof requires only the Laws and Commandments,
but constructing a proof may require creativity, ingenuity, and hard work.
