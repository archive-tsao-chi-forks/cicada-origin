# questions?

- what is the duality between introduction rule and elimination rule?
  (how to use introduction rule to generate elimination rule and all other rules?)
  - adjoint functors -- category theory

- how to read the formation rule, reading introduction rule and elimination rule as little book style laws?
- how to read the computation rule, reading eta rule and sameness rules as little book style commandments?
