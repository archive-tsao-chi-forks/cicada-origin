# repl

- [repl] `cli/commands/repl.ts` -- by `*.piece_by_piece`
- [repl] `cic repl` alias to `cic`
- [repl] `./dev` test `cic repl`

# pie

- [pie] `List` -- `List` `li()` `nil`
- [pie] `Vector` --  `Vector` `vli()` `vnil`

# cicada

- [class] -- handle `this`
  - since we do not have recursion, `this` will be `so far`

- [optimization] use native `number` as `Nat`

- [pattern matching] algebric datatype -- `@datatype`
  - generate `ind`
